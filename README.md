## Inspiration
There are exercises to relieve your eyes tension, unfortunately no one does them. 
That is why we made an app, to know that is the level of your vision.

## What it does
Allows to check the vision without the doctor - only monitor and mobile phone is required.

## How I built it
We done it during meteor hackathon, by two persons, one learning React another Mobile Cordova.

## Challenges I ran into
We've been new in building android app - unfortunately it's not that fast to setup whole environment 
from scratch for mobile development.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
That was great for two persons who have met for a first time yesterday to challenge new 
technologies and to have the working result.

## What I learned
React, Mobile apps development.

## What's next for Save Your Eye
Make it beautiful.
